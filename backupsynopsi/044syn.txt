In this sonnet, which links with s. <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://shakespeare.folger.edu/shakespeares-works/shakespeares-sonnets/sonnet-45/">45</a> to form, in effect, a two-part poem, the poet wishes that he were thought rather than flesh so that he could be with the beloved. The poet, being mortal, is instead made up of the four elements—earth, air, fire, and water. The dullest of these elements, earth and water, are dominant in him and force him to remain fixed in place, weeping “heavy tears.”
