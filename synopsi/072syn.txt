Continuing from s.Â <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://shakespeare.folger.edu/shakespeares-works/shakespeares-sonnets/sonnet-71/">71</a>, this sonnet explains that the beloved can defend loving the poet only by speaking falsely, by giving the poet more credit than he deserves. The beloved is urged instead to forget the poet once he is dead.
