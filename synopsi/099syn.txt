This third poem about the beloved’s absence is closely linked to s. <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://shakespeare.folger.edu/shakespeares-works/shakespeares-sonnets/sonnet-98/">98</a>. In the present sonnet, the poet accuses spring flowers and herbs of stealing color and fragrance from the beloved. The sonnet is unusual in that the first “quatrain” has five lines; the poem therefore has 15 lines, the only such sonnet in the sequence.
