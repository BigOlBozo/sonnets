This final “rival poet” sonnet continues from s. <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://shakespeare.folger.edu/shakespeares-works/shakespeares-sonnets/sonnet-85/">85</a> but echoes the imagery of s. <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://shakespeare.folger.edu/shakespeares-works/shakespeares-sonnets/sonnet-80/">80</a>. The poet explains that his silence is not from fear of his rival, but results from having nothing to write about, now that the rival’s verse has appropriated the beloved’s favor.
