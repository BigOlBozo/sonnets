And only herald to the gaudy spring
If thou couldst answer "This fair child of mine
Calls back the lovely April of her prime;
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee;
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish;
That thou among the wastes of time must go,
Which husbandry in honor might uphold
And, constant stars, in them I read such art
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
Which this time's pencil or my pupil pen
Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
Till Nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,
And then believe me, my love is as fair
As I not for myself but for thee will,
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
After a thousand victories once foiled,
Points on me graciously with fair aspect,
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven;
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
"Had my friend's muse grown with this growing age,
With all-triumphant splendor on my brow,
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss.
Thy adverse party is thy advocate-
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
Although thou steal thee all my poverty;
And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,
And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;
By looking on thee in the living day,
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
By those swift messengers returned from thee,
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
Thyself away are present still with me;
Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,
Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,
Therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made,
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
They live unwooed and unrespected fade,
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
Which parts the shore where two contracted new
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
That you yourself may privilege your time
To this composed wonder of your frame;
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake,
Beated and chopped with tanned antiquity,
Against confounding age's cruel knife,
Or state itself confounded to decay,
Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,
Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins,
Without all ornament, itself and true,
And that, in guess, they measure by thy deeds;
Either not assailed, or victor being charged;
When I, perhaps, compounded am with clay,
That you for love speak well of me untrue,
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
The prey of worms, my body being dead,
And by and by clean starved for a look;
And you and love are still my argument;
Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
Whose influence is thine and born of thee.
From thy behavior; beauty doth he give
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,
Which eyes not yet created shall o'erread;
What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
Which shall be most my glory, being dumb,
Not making worse what nature made so clear,
And to the most of praise add something more;
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
Or me, to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
When other petty griefs have done their spite,
Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
Though to itself it only live and die;
Which for their habitation chose out thee,
If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
But hope of orphans and unfathered fruit;
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both,
If Time have any wrinkle graven there.
Excuse not silence so, for 't lies in thee
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
To mar the subject that before was well?
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;
"Fair, kind, and true," varying to other words;
Of this our time, all you prefiguring;
My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,
Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
Mine appetite I never more will grind
Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;
Of others' voices that my adder's sense
The most sweet favor or deformed'st creature,
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up.
Might I not then say "Now I love you best,"
Within his bending sickle's compass come;
And on just proof surmise accumulate;
The ills that were not, grew to faults assured,
That better is by evil still made better;
My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits,
At my abuses reckon up their own.
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;
Not wond'ring at the present nor the past;
Which works on leases of short-numbered hours,
And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure.
Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
And situation with those dancing chips,
Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;
That music hath a far more pleasing sound.
A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,
O, let it then as well beseem thy heart
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail.
Thou usurer that put'st forth all to use,
And in abundance addeth to his store;
Though in thy store's account I one must be.
Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
And wherefore say not I that I am old?
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;
And in my madness might speak ill of thee.
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee;
Whilst I, thy babe, chase thee afar behind.
Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;
That followed it as gentle day
And let that pine to aggravate thy store.
And, frantic-mad with evermore unrest,
That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
That is so proud thy service to despise,
The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,
Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy;
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
