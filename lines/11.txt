Within thine own bud buriest thy content
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,"
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are
Resembling sire and child and happy mother
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
Be as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
Look whom she best endowed she gave the more,
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
As truth and beauty shall together thrive
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
And your true rights be termed a poet's rage
Nor shall Death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
Him in thy course untainted do allow
And by addition me of thee defeated
As any mother's child, though not so bright
Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
Who plead for love and look for recompense
Are windows to my breast, wherethrough the sun
Is from the book of honor razed quite,
And puts apparel on my tattered loving
Which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
So flatter I the swart complexioned night,
Like to the lark at break of day arising
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
Who all their parts of me to thee did give;
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
But, out alack, he was but one hour mine;
Th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence.
Nor thou with public kindness honor me
That I in thy abundance am sufficed
And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
And yet love knows it is a greater grief
Who lead thee in their riot even there
Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
But that, so much of earth and water wrought,
Who even but now come back again, assured
And by their verdict is determined
For thou no farther than my thoughts canst move,
Within the gentle closure of my breast,
And this my hand against myself uprear
Which heavily he answers with a groan,
Shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race.
To make some special instant special blessed
The other as your bounty doth appear,
Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;
Even in the eyes of all posterity
Come daily to the banks, that, when they see
But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
To what you will; to you it doth belong
Whether we are mended, or whe'er better they,
Feeds on the rarities of Nature's truth,
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
That he shall never cut from memory
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,
And simple truth miscalled simplicity,
For she hath no exchequer now but his,
Making no summer of another's green,
Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse,
My name be buried where my body is
As the death-bed whereon it must expire,
The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
Possessing or pursuing no delight
So all my best is dressing old words new,
Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,
In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
And found it in thy cheek. He can afford
Or, being wracked, I am a worthless boat,
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
Thou, truly fair, wert truly sympathized
For I impair not beauty, being mute,
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
But that is in my thought, whose love to you,
As victors of my silence cannot boast;
So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
The injuries that to myself I do,
Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong
But in the onset come; so shall I taste
Of more delight than hawks or horses be;
O, what a happy title do I find,
Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,
But if that flower with base infection meet,
Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,
How many gazers mightst thou lead away
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
They were but sweet, but figures of delight,
And to his robb'ry had annexed thy breath;
If any, be a satire to decay
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
But that wild music burdens every bough,
For to no other pass my verses tend
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
And in this change is my invention spent,
And, for they looked but with divining eyes,
Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
That it could so preposterously be stained
On newer proof, to try an older friend,
No bitterness that I will bitter think,
To critic and to flatterer stopped are.
The mountain or the sea, the day or night,
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing,
When I was certain o'er incertainty,
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
Bring me within the level of your frown,
And brought to medicine a healthful state
And ruined love, when it is built anew,
And soon to you as you to me then tendered
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
For thy records and what we see doth lie,
But all alone stands hugely politic,
Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art
Her audit, though delayed, answered must be,
At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
A bliss in proof and proved a very woe;
I grant I never saw a goddess go;
One on another's neck do witness bear
To mourn for me, since mourning doth thee grace,
Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;
So thou, being rich in will, add to thy will
For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold
Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,
O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,
Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,
But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me
But being both from me, both to each friend,
Doth follow night, who, like a fiend,
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
No marvel then though I mistake my view;
When all my best doth worship thy defect,
O, though I love what others do abhor,
He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,
I, sick withal, the help of bath desired
Growing a bath and healthful remedy
