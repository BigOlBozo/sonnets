But, as the riper should by time decease,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
Will play the tyrants to the very same
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st
When I behold the violet past prime
Against this coming end you should prepare,
But not to tell of good or evil luck,
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
And fortify yourself in your decay
Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
But when in thee Time's furrows I behold,
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,
To thee I send this written embassage
But then begins a journey in my head
When day's oppression is not eased by night,
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,
And shalt by fortune once more resurvey
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
So shall those blots that do with me remain,
So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,
Thine own sweet argument, too excellent
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring,
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
Thy beauty and thy years full well befits,
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee
For then, despite of space, I would be brought
The first my thought, the other my desire,
Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
When that mine eye is famished for a look,
That to my use it might unused stay
Whenas thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
Doth teach that ease and that repose to say
From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?
The which he will not ev'ry hour survey,
Since everyone hath, every one, one shade,
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Which but today by feeding is allayed,
I have no precious time at all to spend
Or at your hand th' account of hours to crave,
Which, laboring for invention, bear amiss
Each changing place with that which goes before;
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
And for this sin there is no remedy,
When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
And needy nothing trimmed in jollity,
That sin by him advantage should achieve
Before these bastard signs of fair were borne,
All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,
The ornament of beauty is suspect,
Give warning to the world that I am fled
After my death, dear love, forget me quite,
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
My life hath in this line some interest,
And for the peace of you I hold such strife
Why with the time do I not glance aside
The vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
As every alien pen hath got my use
But now my gracious numbers are decayed,
And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
From hence your memory death cannot take,
The dedicated words which writers use
I found, or thought I found, you did exceed
In whose confine immured is the store
Reserve their character with golden quill
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
Upon thy side against myself I'll fight
Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt,
Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
Some in their garments, though newfangled ill,
And life no longer than thy love will stay,
May still seem love to me, though altered new;
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen,
Hath put a spirit of youth in everything,
If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
Both truth and beauty on my love depends;
That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
The argument all bare is of more worth
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
Since all alike my songs and praises be
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
Can yet the lease of my true love control,
What's new to speak, what now to register,
As easy might I from myself depart
Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
That did not better for my life provide
For what care I who calls me well or ill,
Doth part his function, and is partly blind,
Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
Which alters when it alteration finds
Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
As to prevent our maladies unseen
Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,
Needs must I under my transgression bow,
And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed
Which shall above that idle rank remain
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
As subject to time's love or to time's hate,
Or laid great bases for eternity,
Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st
But now is black beauty's successive heir,
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody, full of blame,
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
Is 't not enough to torture me alone,
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there.
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
The better angel is a man right fair,
To me that languished for her sake;
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
Do I not think on thee when I forgot
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
But, as the riper should by time decease,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
But, as the riper should by time decease,
But, as the riper should by time decease,
But, as the riper should by time decease,
But, as the riper should by time decease,
But, as the riper should by time decease,
But, as the riper should by time decease,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
But, as the riper should by time decease,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
But, as the riper should by time decease,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
But, as the riper should by time decease,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
But, as the riper should by time decease,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
But, as the riper should by time decease,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
But, as the riper should by time decease,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
But, as the riper should by time decease,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
But, as the riper should by time decease,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
But, as the riper should by time decease,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
But, as the riper should by time decease,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
