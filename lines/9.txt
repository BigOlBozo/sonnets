Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee
For, having traffic with thyself alone,
Then, were not summer's distillation left
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art
But when from highmost pitch with weary car
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind.
Let those whom nature hath not made for store,
Then of thy beauty do I question make
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
So should the lines of life that life repair
So should my papers, yellowed with their age,
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
And for a woman wert thou first created,
O, let me, true in love, but truly write,
O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary
O, let my books be then the eloquence
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
The painful warrior famoused for worth,
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
Save that my soul's imaginary sight
I tell the day to please him thou art bright
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
Even so my sun one early morn did shine
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense-
I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised
Be thou the tenth muse, ten times more in worth
O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove
I do forgive thy robb'ry, gentle thief,
Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,
If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made
But, ah, thought kills me that I am not thought,
Until life's composition be recured
To 'cide this title is impaneled
So, either by thy picture or my love,
Thee have I not locked up in any chest,
Against that time do I ensconce me here
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
So is the time that keeps you as my chest,
Speak of the spring and foison of the year;
But, for their virtue only is their show,
'Gainst death and all oblivious enmity
Let this sad int'rim like the ocean be
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
Be where you list, your charter is so strong
That I might see what the old world could say
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
O, no. Thy love, though much, is not so great.
But when my glass shows me myself indeed
For such a time do I now fortify
When I have seen such interchange of state,
O, fearful meditation! Where, alack,
And art made tongue-tied by authority,
Why should he live, now Nature bankrout is,
In him those holy antique hours are seen,
They look into the beauty of thy mind,
Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days,
O, if, I say, you look upon this verse
O, lest your true love may seem false in this,
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,
Look what thy memory cannot contain
Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
And do so, love; yet when they have devised
This silence for my sin you did impute,
Let him but copy what in you is writ,
Hearing you praised, I say "'Tis so, 'tis true,"
He, nor that affable familiar ghost
Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
And I by this will be a gainer too;
Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue
If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
Thy love is better than high birth to me,
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
But heaven in thy creation did decree
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
O, what a mansion have those vices got
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray
Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
One blushing shame, another white despair;
Rise, resty muse; my love's sweet face survey
Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
Not that the summer is less pleasant now
Were it not sinful, then, striving to mend,
Ah, yet doth beauty, like a dial hand,
"Fair, kind, and true" is all my argument,
So all their praises are but prophecies
Now with the drops of this most balmy time
So that eternal love in love's fresh case
Never believe, though in my nature reigned
Now all is done, have what shall have no end.
Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink
In so profound abysm I throw all care
For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,
O, 'tis the first: 'tis flattery in my seeing,
Alas, why, fearing of time's tyranny,
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Book both my willfulness and errors down,
Thus policy in love, t' anticipate
O, benefit of ill! Now I find true
O, that our night of woe might have remembered
No, I am that I am; and they that level
That poor retention could not so much hold,
Thy registers and thee I both defy,
It fears not policy, that heretic
No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,
Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!
Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
To be so tickled they would change their state
Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
And, to be sure that is not false I swear,
As those two mourning eyes become thy face.
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,
Then in the number let me pass untold,
Why should my heart think that a several plot
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
Let me excuse thee: ah, my love well knows
For if I should despair, I should grow mad,
But my five wits nor my five senses can
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those
So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,
And whether that my angel be turned fiend
"I hate" she altered with an end
Then, soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
How can it? O, how can love's eye be true,
What merit do I in myself respect
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
But, rising at thy name, doth point out thee
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,
But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new fired,
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
