Making a famine where abundance lies,
To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,
That's for thyself to breed another thee,
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
When every private widow well may keep,
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
If all were minded so, the times should cease,
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
Your self again after yourself's decease
Or say with princes if it shall go well
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,
The age to come would say "This poet lies;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
To the wide world and all her fading sweets.
A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
With April's firstborn flowers and all things rare
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me;
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
And in themselves their pride lies buried,
But that I hope some good conceit of thine
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
The one by toil, the other to complain
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
And weep afresh love's long since canceled woe,
As interest of the dead, which now appear
Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
For no man well of such a salve can speak
Myself corrupting salving thy amiss,
Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit,
For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee
That by this separation I may give
But yet be blamed if thou thyself deceivest
And when a woman woos, what woman's son
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
To the clear day with thy much clearer light
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
My life, being made of four, with two alone
But the defendant doth that plea deny,
Another time mine eye is my heart's guest
Thou best of dearest and mine only care
When love, converted from the thing it was,
As if by some instinct the wretch did know
Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly
Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
Tomorrow see again, and do not kill
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check
Show me your image in some antique book,
Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,
To find out shames and idle hours in me,
And for myself mine own worth do define
Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
And the firm soil win of the wat'ry main,
When rocks impregnable are not so stout
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
To live a second life on second head,
In other accents do this praise confound
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
And hang more praise upon deceased I
Which by and by black night doth take away,
The earth can have but earth, which is his due;
Now counting best to be with you alone,
That every word doth almost tell my name,
Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
Have added feathers to the learned's wing
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
My saucy bark, inferior far to his,
The Earth can yield me but a common grave,
And therefore art enforced to seek anew
How far a modern quill doth come too short,
But he that writes of you, if he can tell
To every hymn that able spirit affords
No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
Of faults concealed wherein I am attainted,
As I'll myself disgrace, knowing thy will;
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
But these particulars are not my measure;
I see a better state to me belongs
In many's looks, the false heart's history
They are the lords and owners of their faces,
Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;
So are those errors that in thee are seen
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
Could make me any summer's story tell,
And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair;
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
Beauty no pencil beauty's truth to lay;
As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,
That overgoes my blunt invention quite,
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,
Therefore my verse, to constancy confined,
I see their antique pen would have expressed
Incertainties now crown themselves assured,
Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
These blenches gave my heart another youth,
To what it works in, like the dyer's hand.
None else to me, nor I to none alive,
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
Creating every bad a perfect best
Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
And rather make them born to our desire
Under the blow of thralled discontent,
For compound sweet forgoing simple savor,
She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
Whilst my poor lips, which should that harvest reap,
Past reason hated as a swallowed bait
And in some perfumes is there more delight
To say they err I dare not be so bold,
Nor that full star that ushers in the even
Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken,
He learned but surety-like to write for me
Shall will in others seem right gracious,
In things of great receipt with ease we prove
Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue;
What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,
To follow that which flies before her face,
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
Was used in giving gentle doom,
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
If it be not, then love doth well denote
Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend
There is such strength and warrantise of skill
My soul doth tell my body that he may
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,
And grew a seething bath which yet men prove
And so the general of hot desire
