But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Then being asked where all thy beauty lies,
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
For never-resting time leads summer on
That use is not forbidden usury
And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
The world will be thy widow and still weep
For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate
Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
When I perceive that men as plants increase,
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
If I could write the beauty of your eyes
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
Making a couplement of proud compare
For all that beauty that doth cover thee
So I for fear of trust forget to say
For through the painter must you see his skill
Great princes' favorites their fair leaves spread
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,
And each, though enemies to either's reign,
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
How many a holy and obsequious tear
Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
All men make faults, and even I in this,
In our two loves there is but one respect,
For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
O, give thyself the thanks if aught in me
Even for this let us divided live
Then, if for my love thou my love receivest,
Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won;
Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:
Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright,
No matter then although my foot did stand
For when these quicker elements are gone
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,
With my love's picture then my eye doth feast
But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
O, what excuse will my poor beast then find
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
So, love, be thou. Although today thou fill
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour
O, let me suffer, being at your beck,
O, that record could with a backward look,
Nativity, once in the main of light,
Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
Hath traveled on to age's steepy night,
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out
And gilded honor shamefully misplaced,
Why should false painting imitate his cheek
Before the golden tresses of the dead,
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,
So thou be good, slander doth but approve
Nay, if you read this line, remember not
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
When thou reviewest this, thou dost review
Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
Why write I still all one, ever the same,
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,
Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing
I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,
Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
And therefore have I slept in your report,
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
I think good thoughts whilst other write good words,
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,
With mine own weakness being best acquainted,
Thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,
Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,
And every humor hath his adjunct pleasure,
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs
For there can live no hatred in thine eye;
They rightly do inherit heaven's graces
That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
As on the finger of a throned queen
And yet this time removed was summer's time,
Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed."
Return, forgetful muse, and straight redeem
Make answer, muse. Wilt thou not haply say
Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
O, blame me not if I no more can write!
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned
Kind is my love today, tomorrow kind,
Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,
Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
That is my home of love. If I have ranged,
Most true it is that I have looked on truth
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand;
You are my all the world, and I must strive
For it no form delivers to the heart
To make of monsters and things indigest
But reckoning time, whose millioned accidents
O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark
That I have frequent been with unknown minds,
Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
For if you were by my unkindness shaken
For why should others' false adulterate eyes
Or, at the least, so long as brain and heart
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
No, it was builded far from accident;
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favor
If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
For since each hand hath put on nature's power,
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight;
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
Yet in good faith some say that thee behold,
And truly not the morning sun of heaven
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,
Will will fulfill the treasure of thy love,
If eyes, corrupt by overpartial looks,
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,
If I might teach thee wit, better it were,
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted,
Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
To win me soon to hell my female evil
Straight in her heart did mercy come,
Why so large cost, having so short a lease,
My reason, the physician to my love,
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
For, thou betraying me, I do betray
But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee
Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love
The fairest votary took up that fire,
