So am I as the rich whose blessd key#Can bring him to his sweet up-lockd treasure,#The which he will not ev'ry hour survey,#  For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.#Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,#Since seldom coming in the long year set,#Like stones of worth they thinly placd are,#  Or captain jewels in the carcanet.#So is the time that keeps you as my chest,#Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide#To make some special instant special blessed#  By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.#  Blessd are you whose worthiness gives scope,  #Being had, to triumph, being lacked, to hope.
